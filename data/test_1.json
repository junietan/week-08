    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the goal of regression in Machine Learning.",
        "answer": "Regression aims to predict a continuous numerical value. It models the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable to forecast a specific number.",

    {
        "question": "What are the basic building blocks of a neural network?",
        "answer": "The basic building blocks are neurons, which are interconnected processing units organized into layers (input, hidden, and output layers).",

    },
    {
        "question": "Why is data visualization important in Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "Data visualization helps in understanding complex data patterns, communicating model results effectively, and identifying potential issues or insights that might be missed otherwise.",
        "marks": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the objective of a capstone project in an ML course?",
        "answer": "The capstone project allows students to apply learned concepts to a real-world problem, design a mini-project, present their findings, and reflect on their learning journey.",
        "marks": 6
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the concept of bias in AI.",
        "answer": "Bias in AI refers to systematic errors or prejudices in an AI system's output, often stemming from biased training data or flawed algorithm design, leading to unfair or discriminatory results.",
        "marks": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "What does it mean for data to be 'cleaned' in the context of ML?",
        "answer": "Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values from a dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability for ML model training.",
        "marks": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between prediction and classification in ML?",
        "answer": "Prediction (regression) forecasts a continuous numerical value, while classification assigns data points to predefined categories or classes.",
        "marks": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a 'pre-trained model' in the context of image recognition?",
        "answer": "A pre-trained model is a neural network that has already been trained on a large dataset for a specific task, like image recognition, and can be used or fine-tuned for new, similar tasks.",
        "marks": 5
    },
    {
        "question": "What is sentiment analysis in NLP?",
        "answer": "Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc., is positive, negative, or neutral.",
