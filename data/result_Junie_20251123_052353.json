            "correct_answer": "NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for data visualization.",

            "question": "Explain the core difference between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as presented in Weeks 8 and 9, respectively.",
            "student_answer": "aaa",
            "correct_answer": "CNNs are primarily used for image recognition by processing spatial hierarchies, while RNNs are designed for sequence data, remembering past information.",

            "question": "In Week 6, what are the key metrics used for evaluating classification models, and what do precision and recall specifically measure?",
            "student_answer": "accuracy",
            "correct_answer": "Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives.",

            "question": "What are the main topics covered under 'AI Ethics & Fairness' in Week 13, and why are they important for developing AIML solutions?",
            "student_answer": "make sure ai dont take over the world",
            "correct_answer": "Topics include bias, transparency, and responsible AI. They are crucial to ensure AIML systems are fair, unbiased, and used ethically, preventing harm and promoting trust.",

            "question": "Describe the purpose of unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering and PCA as covered in Weeks 10 and 11.",
            "student_answer": "find hidden patterns  in data",
            "correct_answer": "K-means groups similar data points into clusters. PCA reduces the number of variables in a dataset while retaining most of the information, simplifying analysis.",

            "earned_marks": 5.0,
            "ai_feedback": "Your answer captures a very general purpose of unsupervised learning, but it lacks the specificity required to describe K-means and PCA.  It would be beneficial to mention the specific goals of clustering and dimensionality reduction."
