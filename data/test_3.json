        "question": "In Week 6, what are the key metrics used for evaluating classification models, and what do precision and recall specifically measure?",
        "answer": "Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives.",

        "question": "What are the main topics covered under 'AI Ethics & Fairness' in Week 13, and why are they important for developing AIML solutions?",
        "answer": "Topics include bias, transparency, and responsible AI. They are crucial to ensure AIML systems are fair, unbiased, and used ethically, preventing harm and promoting trust.",
        "marks": 20

    {
        "question": "Describe the purpose of unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering and PCA as covered in Weeks 10 and 11.",
        "answer": "K-means groups similar data points into clusters. PCA reduces the number of variables in a dataset while retaining most of the information, simplifying analysis.",
